# rest-security
Rest-service security test project; message encryption / signing / authorization

Test project for (REST) service security. 
Initial version 2015/10/29 supports message signing and encryption.

As this is just a test project, some manual work is needed to set up client (keys / secrets).

Currently tested only with Tomcat 7 (JBoss 7.x has some security settings based issues with bouncy castle libs inside war. -> will be resolved later).
